## Introduction

Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA) is a great way to structure your code. Getting started with a new or familiar architecture can be daunting, so I've created a quick start guide to get you up and running by using a `dotnet new` template.

### What is Vertical Slice Architecture?

VSA is primarily about separating use cases or features entirely, in such a way that they do not rely or communicate on each other. This is reflected via the 'vertical' nature of the architecture, where each feature is a vertical slice of the application.

Compared to traditional structures like N-tier or even Clean Architecture, where they are organised in ways of grouping by technical concern (Web API, Data Access), VSA groups by the feature or use case.

To get a quick briefing on a few of the key players in Software Architecture watch my User Group here:

[Vertical Slice Architecture: How Does it Compare to Clean Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMgj1MdwrRE)

This theory is all well and good, but how do I represent this in a .NET Application?

### The Template

[https://github.com/Hona/VerticalSliceArchitecture](https://github.com/Hona/VerticalSliceArchitecture)

The template is a simple .NET 8 template that creates a solution with 1 source project (ASP.NET Core) & 1 test project (xUnit).

The source project is setup with a few important folders to get you started:

```tree
📁 [ProjectName]/
│
│── 📁 Features/ 
│   │
│   │── 📁 Todo/
│       │── 🤔
|
│── 📁 Common/ 
    │── 📄 AppDbContext.cs
    │── 📄 *
```

What is inside each feature folder however?

This is where a little magic happens.

```tree
📁 Todo/
│
│── 📁 CreateTodo/
│   │── 📄 CreateTodoEndpoint.cs
│   │── 📄 CreateTodoRequest.cs
|
|── 📁 GetTodo/
|   │── 📄 *
|
|── 📁 [...]
|
|── 📄 TodoEntity.cs
|── 📄 TodoRepository.cs
|── 📄 DependencyInjection.cs
```

From here, as you can see - each feature contains an entity & repository for each use case to consume. As well as a Dependency Injection class to wire up services to the IoC container.

This is a great way to get started with VSA, and I hope you find it useful! 

Bigger enterprise apps will need more features & different things to consider, like a Modular Monolith. But, that is for another time.

### How to use the template

To use the template, you need to install it first. This is done via the `dotnet new` command.

```bash
dotnet new install Hona.VerticalSliceArchitecture.Template
```

Then, create a project (e.g. called 'Sprout')

```bash
mkdir Sprout
cd Sprout

dotnet new hona-vsa
```

Let me know your thoughts below, or if I should add anything else to the template!
